## Introduction and expectation


## Requirement for the system
- minimize deduction for more random access
- a pluggable blueprint 
- decompose big system into smaller components


## An abstract system


## Scale degree


## Notation

## Never memorize!


## Learn intervals first!


## Practice 2 shapes first!


## Octave Barebone


## Add fifth


## Appegios

## Break into pieces (Shapes)

## Plug in Shell voicing

## Move across shapes with vertical shapes


## Reify the abstract system with concrete notes


## Minor variation


## Diminished Variation


## Overlap diatonic shapes in one position 


## Plug in major pentatonic 


## Major pentatonic plug in blues notes 


## Major pentatonic plug in 7th (Hexatonic)

 
## Plug in vertical pentatonic 


## Minor pentatonic and plugins (Shift from major shape)


## Practice strategies

- practice 2 concecutive shapes individually
- practice 2 shapes together
- pick next 2 shapes 
- when getting bord improvise over some tracks
    - be aware of the key you're playing.
    - play chords first
    - then appegio
    - then just solo. Try to hit notes you just practiced
- repeat
