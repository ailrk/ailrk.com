description: Simplify the fretboard

There are lots of ways to visualize the fretboard, after watching 100+ videos on youtube about this topic, I conclude that everyone has their own system. Just observing the way people describe the CAGED system, usually you will hear different versions from different people. Some people think it's a god send system that opened up the possibility, some people think it's pretty pointless, instead they use something their own. In this post I want to describe the system I use as I'm learning guitar.
